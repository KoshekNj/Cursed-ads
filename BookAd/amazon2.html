        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            A stunning debut from a well known Christian book reviewer Samantha M. Johson, the woman behind the largest church book club in her hometown of Hutchinson, Minessota. Heart of a Guard, Touch of a Wolf is a dark erotic fantasy novel following Lauryn, a shielded princess who’s journey to the allying kingdom has been abruptly stopped by the forest gypsy gang. Sure that she will die, she closes her eyes, only to wake up again somewhere she has never been to before, with a stranger introducing himself as a guard standing above her, sweaty, breathing heavily, thigh clothes scrunching around the bulge more and more each second....

            <p>“Not saying this because I know her, though knowing her is truly a blessing, but this book is AMAZING. I’ve read it in one sitting. Let me tell you, my hubby and kids were not happy - there was no dinner that day. I was on the edge of my seat the entire afternoon and the climax was totally worth it ;)))))”</p>

            <p>"This is a really fun and fast read with an average story, but a really good romance. Eventhough Lauryn is slightly annoying throughout the entire story, the guard and his ways are so well written, I have to admit, I’ve gasped audibly multiple times...would recommend if you are looking for a good erotica."</p>

            <p>"Wow. Just wow. Cannot believe that this is her first published book. It’s steamy and sexy and most importantly, it is written by another fellow Christian."</p>
