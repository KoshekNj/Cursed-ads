        <p>
            The Amazon’s bestselling author, internet famous book reviewer and The Hutchinson Church Book Club leader Samantha M. Johnson is back with another dark fantasy erotica that will haunt your imagination for days. </p>
            <p> It was just another day of mushrooms foraging for Demiana, a lovely wife of the hardworking royal wood chopper from the lush region of Lignuma, when suddenly a wolf appears before her. He is not agressive, his eyes are warm and inviting, giving her a sudden urge to get close to him, to follow him...and so she does, leading her to a long abandoned castle, in which nothing is as it seems, especially not the wolf. As home life gets shakier and visits to the castle get more sensual, Demiana knows her life will never be the same. The question is, how high of the price is she willing to pay for revival of her long lost desire?

            <p>"Now, Samantha and I have been best friends for 19 years now. Or so I THOUGHT. Looking at this hot piece of crap cover, you might wonder what happened, since her last two releases had ABSOLUTELY STUNNING covers. Well I’ll tell you - the last two covers were made by my BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED 17yo daughter MAKAYLYNN. I raised my daughter with Christian values, so at the begenning of Samantha’s career, when her financial situation wasn’t great, my daughter did those covers for free to support Samantha in her dreams. After the success of the first two books, for which my daughter’s EYE CATCHING covers were certainly to thank for, not only did she not pay her a cent. No. She did not even choose Makaylynn for the Hutchinson Cheerleading Team, though she NAILED the audition choreo and the audience LOVED HER. She got THE LOUDEST cheers. We were certain that she will get in, but guess what. Her name was never called for the team Samantha has assembled. My daughter made her dreams come true, and then that hag thanked her by destroying her young dreams completely. Obliterated her hopeful soul. Why would that demonic spirit do that to us, eventhough we always did everything we could to support her, I don’t know. But she will not go unpunished. Isaiah 13:11"</p>

            <p>“The book was good, but the cover made me ROFL. I changed the rating to one star because of all the drama. I just cannot support taking advantage of minors. She should compensate that girl who made the covers fairly, especially since the books sold really well"</p>

            <p>"DON’T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SEE ON THE INTERNET! I know personally both Samantha and Makaylynn’s mom, Marissa Ann, and what she’s telling is half truth. I was there on the audition, Makaylynn hit the mascot while doing a leg kick!!! Don’t you agree that is a dangerous situation??? She could not be put on the team, of course. Her arms were also a bit stiff, the motions looked painful, I could almost hear her elbows crackling as she did those punch ups...Her jumps were also not in sync with ANYONE, like calm down Beyonce? YOU are not supposed to be leading, you need to FOLLOW. And don’t pretend that Samantha never did anything for you! For starters, Makaylynn was failing chemistry HARD and without Samantha’s tutoring, she would be stuck in 10th grade forever! Also never officially acknowledged, but Miss Marissa Ann, we know you stole that casserole recipe from Samantha! We know that Samantha’s secret pesto recipe when we taste it! Poor Samantha was inconsolable when she realized what her supposed “friend” did behind her back, on the Fundraising for The Annual Nativity Re-enactment in Hutchinson Church...I don’t want to attack anyone, so I’ll stop now. But if you are reading this - please, give this book a chance. Samantha is very serious about writing and it would be sad if all her hard work was for nothing because of some vengeful fake friend...think about how you would feel in her shoes < / 3"</p>
