        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            The Amazonâ€™s bestselling author, internet famous book reviewer and The Hutcherson Church Book Club leader Samantha M. Johnson is back with another dark fantasy erotica that will haunt your imagination for days. Demiana, a lovely wife of the royal wood chopper goes to forage for mushrooms in the forest as she does every day, when suddenly a wolf appears before her. He is not agressive, his eyes are warm and inviting, giving her a sudden urge to get close to him, to follow him...and so she does, leading her to a long abandoned castle, in which nothing is as it seems, especially not the wolf...
